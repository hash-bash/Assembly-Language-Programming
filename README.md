# Assembly Language Programming
Problem Statements are:

1. Write X86/64 ALP to count number of positive and negative numbers from the array.

2. Write X86/64 ALP to perform non-overlapped and overlapped block transfer (with and without string specific instructions). Block containing data can be defined in the data segment.

3. Write 64 bit ALP to convert 4-digit Hex number into its equivalent BCD number and 5-digit BCD number into its equivalent HEX number. Make your program user friendly to accept the choice from user for:
  a) HEX to BCD
  b) BCD to HEX
  c) EXIT
  Display proper strings to prompt the user while accepting the input and displaying the result. (use of 64-bitregisters is expected).

4. Write X86/64 ALP to perform multiplication of two 8-bit hexadecimal numbers. Use successive addition and add and shift method. (use of 64-bit registers is expected)

5. Write X86 ALP to find, a) Number of Blank spaces b) Number of lines c) Occurrence of a particular character. Accept the data from the text file. The text file has to be accessed during Program_1 execution and write FAR PROCEDURES in Program_2 for the rest of the processing. Use of PUBLIC and EXTERN directives is mandatory.

6. Write X86/64 ALP to switch from real mode to protected mode and display the values of GDTR, LDTR, IDTR, TR and MSWRegisters.

7. Write X86 program to sort the list of integers in ascending/descending order. Read the input from the text file and write the sorted data back to the same text file using bubble sort.

8. Write X86 menu driven Assembly Language Program (ALP) to implement OS (DOS) commands TYPE, COPY and DELETE using file operations. User is supposed to provide command line arguments in all cases.

9. Write x86 ALP to find the factorial of a given integer number on a command line by using recursion. Explicit stack manipulation is expected in the code.

10. Write 80387 ALP to obtain: i) Mean ii) Variance iii) Standard Deviation Also plot the histogram for the data set. The data elements are available in a text file.
